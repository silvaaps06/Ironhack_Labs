# Ironhack_Labs

This repo contains all of the practical exercises I did during the Data Analytics Bootcamp @ Ironhack. 
The entire course lasted for 9 weeks (17/Jan - 18/Mar 2022) with an additional career week. It was divided into 3 modules:

- Git, Python and SQL
- Statistics and probability
- Machine Learning
